attempt is made to keep this list accurate for the master branch.

Version 17.02.0 (February 14, 2017)
  * General
    - Bumped copyright dates
  * Legion
    - Merged versioning branch with support for a higher performance
        version numbering computation
    - More efficient analysis for index space task launches
    - Updated custom projection function API
    - Added support for speculative mapping of predicated operations
    - Added index space copy and fill operations
  * Legion Prof
    - Added a stats view of processors grouped by node and processor type
    - Added ability to collapse/expand each processor/channel/memory in
        a timeline. To collapse/expand a row, click the name. To 
        collapse/expand the children of a row, click on the triangle 
        next to the name.
    - Grouped the processor timelines to be child elements under the stats
        views
    - Added on-demand loading of each processor/stats in a timeline.
        Elements are only loaded when you expand them, saving bandwidth
  * CMake
    - Switched to separate flags for each of the Legion extras directories:
          -DLegion_BUILD_APPS (for ./apps)
          -DLegion_BUILD_EXAMPLES (for ./examples)
          -DLegion_BUILD_TUTORIAL (for ./tutorial)
          -DLegion_BUILD_TESTS (for ./test)

Version 16.10.0 (October 7, 2016)
  * Realm
    - HDF5 support: moved to Realm module, added DMA channels
    - PAPI support: basic profiling (instructions, caches, branches) added
  * Build flow
    - Fixes to support compilation in 32-bit mode
    - Numerous improvements to CMake build
  * Regent
    - Improvements to vectorization of structured codes
  * Apps
    - Removed bit-rotted applications - some have been replaced by examples
        or Regent applications
  * Tests
    - New test infrastructure and top-level test script `test.py`

Version 16.08.0 (August 30, 2016)
  * Realm
    - Critical-enough ("error" and "fatal" by default, controlled with
        -errlevel) logging messages are mirrored to stderr when -logfile is
        used
    - Command-line options for logging (-error and new -errlevel) support
        English names of logging levels (spew, debug, info, print,
        warn/warning, error, fatal, none) as well as integers
  * Legion
    - Rewrite of the Legion shutdown algorithm for improved scalability
      and avoiding O(N^2) behavior in the number of nodes
  * Regent
    - Installer now prompts for RDIR installation
  * Tools
    - Important Legion Spy performance improvements involving transitive
        reductions

Version 16.06.0 (June 15, 2016)
  * Legion
    - New mapper API:
        use ShimMapper for limited backwards compatibility
    - New task variant registration API
        supports specifying layout constraints for region requirements
        old interface is still available but deprecated
    - Several large bug fixes for internal version numbering computation
  * C API
    - The context parameter for many API calls has been removed
  * Tools
    - Total re-write of Legion Spy

Version 16.05.0 (May 2, 2016)
